1. the longer the player wall-rides, the longer the momentum effect lasts.
	- momentumTime variable

2. momentum changes to point in the direction you were last moving.

3. momentum magnitude decreases over time but only after it's "momentumTime" ends.
	- (1 - EaseInQuad)

4. momentum's magnitude never increases and cannot exceed the magnitude of the previous displacement.
	- displacement_n+1 <= d_n
